## Baseline Model

Make sure you have the relevant packages installed, including PyTorch, numpy, and matplotlib.

You must have a `dogs` directory in the project root. The directory structure should be as such:

- `dogs/`
  - `dogs/`
    - `dog.0.png`
    - `dog.1.png`
    - `...`

The baseline model was originally trained on Google Colab. Therefore, the first cell may be deleted for reproduction. Additionally, the `dataroot` in the fourth cell may be modified with the correct path, i.e., the `dogs` directory.

The dataset, Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). Remember to filter out only dog images for training the model.
